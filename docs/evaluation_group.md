# Evaluation on the group project as a whole

When I am looking back over the course of our project, it can be said that our project group performed well. In general, the group made some really good progress and we all tried our best in order to successfully complete this minor and the specific project for TNO.

The project did not always go so smoothly, mainly because of reasons that were out of our hands, for example acquiring the dataset. This was a very long, painful and vague process for a longer period during the project. This was mainly because TNO did not know themselves how they would like to transfer the data to us and how we would be working with it. Finally, the option was chosen to send vectorized data via mail, so that we could work at school instead of on-site (since it was not efficient for us to work on TNO since we always needed to have a guide). This was a bit of a hassle, since the preprocess script was locally made every time and it took a very long time for TNO to execute the script on their network in order to send us back the vectors. Every time errors occurred at TNO as a result of the script, it had to be locally debugged or functions needed to be added, to send it back again and hope for a response in time.

Since I also was the one struggling the most getting started and familiar with the whole programming experience, my group always tried to help me wherever they could like helping me understand code/syntax, solving certain problems I stumbled upon, explaining thoughts, etc. The group was very helpful towards one another, everybody was always open to each other and we were always working in a very nice atmosphere at school.

For reflection purposes, a single occasion is taken in order to reflect upon using the STARR-method.

## Situation

It was one of the first meetings we had at TNO, approximately the second week, so it was in the very beginning of the minor when we were all still experimenting with how data science and Python work. Everybody had some working code and results they could show, excluding me since I was still struggling with how Python worked. Our product owner asked to each show us individually what results we had made in our Jupyter notebooks. I already had some experimenting done with the Kaggle set and Python, but not so much that it was on par with the rest of the group.

## Task

Show our product owner what result each single one of us made and if we had any question so he could help us. Many of us already had some significant results so early in the minor and could really show some promising results.

## Action

When the product owner came by and asked me to show me what results I made, I had to tell him that I was still experimenting a lot with Python and coding itself, so that I not made as much progress as the rest of the group.

## Result

However, I did come up with some ideas that could be implemented during that meeting that would encourage the rest of the group to work on (e.g. One of my ideas was that we had to look into other columns, like the ‘remarks’ column in the Kaggle set, in order to check if there was any relevant information that would benefit training a model). They also said that my ideas were great and that if I needed any help or got ideas that I could not realize myself, would throw into the group so that maybe one of the other group members could work on it.

## Reflect

This way, I found out that it did not matter that I was struggling more than the rest of the group, since we were all trying our best to contribute to the project. This really made me feel comfortable within the group knowing that my contribution and ideas are welcome and appreciated. Since I am not very open about these kinds of things, I am very proud of myself and think that I handled it well. This resulted in even more motivation in contributing to the project.
