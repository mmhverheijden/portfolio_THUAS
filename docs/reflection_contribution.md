# Reflection on own contribution to the project

When looking at my contribution towards the project in comparison to my fellow project members, I was the one who was most of the time learning and catching up to the rest of the group. This is mostly because I am very new to the whole field of Data Science and engineering (since I am a business IT student) and the rest of my group consists of software engineers. This put me at a disadvantage, but nevertheless did I try my best to catch up with the rest and do my part of the project.

My own personal contributions to the project consist of:
