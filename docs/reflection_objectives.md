# Reflection on own learning objectives

Before I started this minor, there were specific objectives that I had in mind that I wanted to focus on. The main objectives that I determined for myself were:

* getting used to programming in Python,
* exploring the various sections within Data Science,
* experience working in the field of Data Science,
* stepping out of my comfort zone of business IT,
* acquiring more technological knowledge,
* understanding the concept of machine learning, deep learning and neural networks.

During this minor, I can state that this really expanded my interest in the field of Data Science even more and that this really is something that I still see myself doing in ten years. It also helped me realize that I still have a very deep interest in coding and that this is something I want to focus on even more in order to retrain myself to become a developer/software engineer as well, instead of a business consultant. The level required to be an efficient data scientist is still relatively high for me in my opinion, especially since I am not very accustomed to coding and mathematics. But this will not be an obstacle for me in order to become a professional data scientist later in my career. The minor also showed me all the different sections within data science, for example exploratory data analysis, cleaning data, validating models, etc. These were things that did not really come up to me at the beginning of this minor, when I had a different vision about data science.

Besides completing my learning objectives, I also got to learn and experience some other aspects that are relevant to becoming a software engineers/data scientist, namely:

* using Github and Gitlab in order to efficiently collaborate with others and to structure code,
* using LaTeX in combination with BibTeX in order to write professional articles,
* working with Terminal

For reflection purposes, a single occasion is taken in order to reflect upon using the STARR-method.

## Situation

The project group concluded that it was necessary for the paper to be written in LaTeX, even though no one really worked with it before or knew how it worked. At that time, our paper was still written as a draft within our shared Google Drive. This required the group to acquire knowledge about this format and how we needed to utilize it for the paper and how we would transfer our paper from one format to another.

## Task

The project group needed to get familiar with how LaTeX works, what the syntax is, where to work in, setting up an environment to work in, etc. Because it was also something no one of the project group really worked with before and it was not very clear how this was correlated to the paper, so we had to find that out as well.

## Action

Since the group found out this was a necessity for the paper to be graded, I acted into finding out what was necessary to understand and use LaTeX combined with BibTeX. Following tutorials, looking for examples and setting up a single test environment for myself using Sublime Text. After digging deeper into the tools that can be used, the online tool called *‘Overleaf’* was found which is a collaborative tool usable in the web browser in order to conduct various documents using LaTeX, which perfectly suited our situation.

## Result

The result of this action was that I had a clear understanding of how to conduct a professional research paper using LaTeX, combined with setting up a collaborative environment for the project group to work in. This way it was very easy for the rest of the group to get used to the syntax and how to work in the environment. Also, any questions that the rest of the group had, could be answered in order to clear things up.

## Reflect

Personally thinking, I handled well because this was the first step to convert our paper from a Google Documents file to a professional looking paper. Also, I took matters into my own hand and showed initiative in order to tell the group that I would be one to research this topic. We all agreed and the next day (after the weekend since it was a late Friday evening) I told the group my findings. They were very happy with what I found, and we immediately applied what we learned towards the paper.
