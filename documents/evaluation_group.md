# Evaluation on the group project as a whole

When I am looking back over the course of our project, it can be said that our project group performed pretty well.

The project did not always went that smoothly, mainly because of reasons that were out of our hands, for example acquiring the dataset. This was a very long, painful and vague process for a longer period of time during the project. This was mainly because TNO did not know themselves how they would like to transfer the data to us and how we would be working with it. Finally, the option was chosen to send vectorized data via mail, so that we could work at school in stead of on-site.

Since I also was the one struggling the most getting started and familiar with the whole programming experience, my group always tried to help me wherever they could like helping me understand code/syntax, solving certain problems I stumbled upon, explaining thoughts, etc. The group was very helpful towards one another.
