# Reflection on own learning objectives

Before I started this minor, there were specific objectives that I had in mind that I wanted to focus on. The main objectives that I determined for myself were:

* getting used to programming in Python,
* exploring the various sections within Data Science,
* experience working in the field of Data Science,
* stepping out of my comfort zone of business IT,
* understanding the concept of machine learning, deep learning and neural networks.

During this minor, I can state that this really expanded my interest in the field of Data Science even more and that this really is something that I still see myself doing in ten years. It also helped me realize that I still have a very deep interest in coding and that this is something I want to focus on even more in order to retrain myself to become a developer/software engineer as well, instead of a business consultant. The level required to be an efficient data scientist is still relatively high for me in my opinion, especially since I am not very accustomed to coding and mathematics. But this will not be an obstacle for me in order to become a professional data scientist later on in my career. The minor also showed me all the different sections within data science, for example exploratory data analysis, cleaning data, validating models, etc. These were things that did not really come up to me at the beginning of this minor, when I had a different vision about data science.

Besides completing my learning objectives, I also got to learn and experience some other aspects that are relevant to becoming a software engineers/data scientist, namely:

* using Github and Gitlab in order to efficiently collaborate with others and to structure code,
* using LaTeX in combination with BibTeX in order to write professional articles,
* working with Terminal

For reflection purposes, a single occasion is taken in order to reflect upon using the STARR-method.

## Situation

The project group came to the conclusion that it was necessary for the paper to be written in LaTeX, even though no one really worked with it before or knew how it worked.

## Task

The project group needed to get familiar with how LaTeX works, what the syntax is, where to work in, setting up an environment to work in, etc.

## Action

Since the group found out this was a necessity for the paper to be graded, I took action into finding out what was necessary to understand and use LaTeX combined with BibTeX. Following tutorials, looking for examples and setting up a single test environment for myself using Sublime Text. After digging deeper into the tools that can be used, Overleaf was found which is a collaborative tool usable in the webbrowser in order to conduct a paper.

## Result

The result of this action was that I had a clear understanding of how to conduct a professional research paper using LaTeX, combined with setting up a collaborative environment for the project group to work in. This way it was very easy for the rest of the group to get used to the syntax and how to work in the environment. Also any questions that the rest of the group had, could be answered in order to clear things up.
