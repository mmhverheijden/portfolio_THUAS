# Reflection on own learning objectives

Before I started this minor, there were specific objectives that I had in mind that I wanted to focus on. The main objectives that I determined for myself were:

* getting used to programming in Python,
* exploring Data Science,
* experience working in the field of Data Science,
* m
* m
* m

During this minor, I can state that this really expanded my interest in the field of Data Science even more and that this really is something that I still see myself doing in ten years. It also helped me realize that I still have a very deep interest in coding and that this is something that I want to retrain myself to become a developer as well, instead of a business consultant.
The level required to be an efficient data scientist is still relatively high for me in my opinion, especially since I am not very accustomed to coding and mathematics. But this will not be an obstacle for me in order to become a professional data scientist later on in my career.

Besides completing my learning objectives, I also got to learn and experience some other aspects that are relevant to becoming a software engineers/data scientist, namely:

* using Github and Gitlab in order to efficiently collaborate with others and to structure code,
* using LaTeX in combination with BibTeX in order to write professional articles,
* working with Terminal

## Situation

The project group came to the conclusion that it was necessary for the paper to be written in LaTeX, even though no one really worked with it before or knew how it worked.

## Task

The project group needed to get familiar with how LaTeX works, what the syntax is, where to work in, etc.
