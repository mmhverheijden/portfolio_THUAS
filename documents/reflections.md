# Reflections

This document will describe the reflections that are written by Mike Verheijden regarding the contributions that are made towards the project, the learning objectives that are formulated and the group project as a whole. Every reflection will consist of a detailed explanation and usage of the STARR-method about a specific situation.

### STARR

## Reflection on own learning objectives

Before I started this minor, there were specific objectives that I had in mind that I wanted to focus on. The main objectives that I determined for myself were getting used to programming in Python.

During this minor, I can state that this really expanded my interest in the field of Data Science even more and that this really is something that I still see myself doing in ten years. It also helped me realize that I still have a very deep interest in coding and that this is something that I want to retrain myself to become a developer as well, instead of a business consultant.
The level required to be an efficient data scientist is still really high for me in my opinion, especially since I am not very accustomed to coding and mathematics. But this will not be an obstacle for me in order to become a professional data scientist later on in my career.

## Evaluation on the gorup project as a whole

When I am looking back over the course of our project, it can be said that our project group performed pretty well. The project did not always went that smoothly, mainly because of reasons that were out of our hands.
